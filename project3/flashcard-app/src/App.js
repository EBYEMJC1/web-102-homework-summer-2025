      question: "What is an activation record?",
      answer: "An activation record is a stack frame that stores function call information (local variables, return address, etc)."
    },
    {
      question: "When you call a new function in x86-64, what happens to the 16-byte boundary, RBP, RIP, and RSP?",
      answer: "RSP is aligned to a 16-byte boundary, RBP is pushed to save old base, RIP (return address) is pushed, and RSP is adjusted for local storage."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the steps to convert a decimal number to IEEE 754 format?",
      answer: "1) Convert decimal to binary. 2) Normalize to 1.xxxx * 2^n. 3) Determine sign bit. 4) Calculate exponent and bias. 5) Write out sign, exponent, and mantissa bits."
    },
    {
      question: "What are macros in x86-64 assembly?",
      answer: "Macros are preprocessor instructions that let you define code templates that expand at assembly time."
    },
    {
      question: "What is included in the .data section?",
      answer: "The .data section stores initialized global and static variables."
    },
    {
      question: "What is included in the .bss section?",
      answer: "The .bss section contains uninitialized global and static variables."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the declarations section in assembly?",
      answer: "The declarations section is used to declare symbols, functions, or dataâ€”often before use or for external linkage."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the .text section for?",
      answer: "The .text section contains the executable instructions (code) of the program."
    },
    {
      question: "To import a C++ function into assembly using 'extern', in which section would you declare it?",
      answer: "In the declarations section, you use 'extern' to declare external functions."
